### JonDump

## what is this?!
its a tool used to Dump GBA save games with a ds via download play. They are saved onto a DS game's save data, and then are able to be dumped with a 3ds and used from there.

## WHY!
I dont actually have any tools to dump gba saves until i wrote this, so i was desperate.

## Borrowed code
A LOT of the code was borrowed from [here](https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss/nds-savegame-manager) to help with reading the saves.

## How 2 use 101
Just compile with devkitpro really, you may have to install dsgmlib until i completely remove the leftovers
